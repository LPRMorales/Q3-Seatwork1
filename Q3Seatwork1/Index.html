				<td>A young girl discovers a mysterious map. Going soundly to sleep, she enters a dream thst brought back old memories. As the dream went on, she found and an eccentric outlaw in search of the map that leads to pearls that'll make anything wish of yours come true. With him and this map, she traverses dreams and flees nightmares, with the hope that she will be able to see her late father again.</td>
				<td>Jason Momoa(Flip), Marlow Barkley(Nemo), Chris O'Dowd(Nemo's Uncle/"Flip"), Weruche Opia(Agent Green)</td>
				<td><p><b>John Anderson</b></p>
					<p>Ms. Barkley comes across as a kid rather than a studio creation. Mr. Momoa gives the kind of unhinged performance of which few would have thought him capable. His prancing about at moments of joy are, in fact, joyous.</p>
					<p><b>Robert Roten</b></p>
					<p>What the actors, music and visual creative teams have here done is create a magical world that relates to the real world as well. It goes beyond the coming of age genre, dealing with parenthood and retaining the wonder of childhood as an adult.</p></td>

				<td>A couple decide to start a family of their own after feeling a void in their marriage. They weren't sure where to begin, till they stumble into the world of foster care adoption. They hope to take in one small child, but when they meet three siblings, including a hard-headed 15-year-old, they find themselves speeding from zero to three kids unexpectedly overnight.</td>
				<td>Mark Wahlberg(Pete), Rose Byrne(Ellie), Isabela Merced(Lizzy), Gustavo Escobar(Juan), Julianna Gamiz(Lita)</td>
				<td><p><b>Simran Hans</b></p>
				<p>Anders and his wife are parents to three adopted children, and there's a sense of verisimilitude and attention to detail regarding both the joys and the travails of foster care.</p>
				<p><b>Mark Kermode</b></p>
				<p>I was surprisingly taken by it.</p></td>
				<td>⭐⭐⭐⭐.8</td>

				<td>An adventurous girl who still suffers the death of her mother who used to tell her stories about the mythical moon goddess, Chang'e, builds a rocket ship to meet the goddess on the moon to hopefully rekindle the old connection she had with her father and to hopefully cancel the marriage of with his new spouse.</td>
				<td>Cathy Ang(Fei Fei), Phillipa Soo(Chang'e), Sandra Oh(Mrs. Zhong), Ken Jeong(Gobi)</td>
				<td><p><b>Leonard Maltin (top critic)</b></p>
					<p>Some reviewers have criticized the film for being too Disney-esque. I'm not sure why that's a bad thing--but I'll grant you that the movie feels comfortably familiar.</p>
					<p><b>Tasha Robinson (top critic)</b></p>
					<p>Over the Moon's emotional journey is solid and well-expressed. Again, it draws on calculated iconography... But Fei Fei's emotional journey is a universal story about feeling pain and learning to move on</p></td>
				<td>⭐⭐⭐⭐.4</td>
